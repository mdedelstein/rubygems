										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GitHub.com now remembers multiple accounts in your browser. You can find the account switcher in your profile picture context menu, letting you more easily switch between user accounts without re-entering your credentials.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.com/github/release-assets/assets/1666363/bd646682-187d-42e5-96c2-1ddfdc76f240" alt="image"></p>
<p>The account switcher helps developers alternate between Enterprise Managed User accounts provided by an employer and personal accounts for use with personal projects and open source contributions. It also helps administrators manage service accounts they use for automation and integration purposes.</p>
<p>Because these accounts often have significantly different privileges, there&#039;s never any mixing of user permissions between saved accounts. When you visit a page that your current account can&#039;t access, you&#039;ll see a prompt to switch accounts if you have more than one signed in.</p>
<p>When you switch accounts, you won&#039;t need to sign in again or perform 2FA unless the account session has expired. Session expiration occurs after two weeks without activity. SAML/OIDC SSO authorization is also saved for sessions, but often expires every 1 or 24 hours, and may need to be done again before you can access your organization resources.</p>
<p>To learn more, see &quot;<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/switching-between-accounts">Switching between accounts</a>&quot;.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GitHub Enterprise Cloud customers with Enterprise Managed Users (EMU) now have access to additional administrative capabilities for SCIM information. Troubleshooting user management at scale can <span class="x x-first x-last">take time and effort</span>. To make this easier on administrators, we have added <span class="x x-first x-last">several new </span>audit log fields, external identity metadata, and a new team membership synchronization status. The audit log field updates include<span class="x x-first x-last"> the following</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>New field <code>external_group.update_display_name</code>: Our logs will now capture and report any changes made to an external group&#8217;s display name.</li>
<li>New field <code>external_group.add_member</code>: When a team member is added to an external group, this action will be audit logged.</li>
<li>New field <code>external_group.remove_member</code>: When a team member is removed from an external group, this action will be audit logged.</li>
<li>Enhancements to <code>external_group.update</code> and <code>external_identity.update</code> to ensure consistency whenever an external group or identity is updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SSO page for each user also now includes SCIM metadata for that user in addition to existing SAML metadata. Check out what&#8217;s new by filling in this url <code>https://github.com/enterprises/your-enterprise/people/username/sso</code> with your enterprise and a valid username.</p>
<p>Team membership synchronization status checks GitHub&#8217;s understanding of identity groups against the current members of linked teams. This allows us to flag mismatches for administrators related to license allocation or other concerns.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>GitHub-hosted Runners: Private Networking with Azure Virtual Networks - Public Beta</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.blog/changelog/2023-11-01-github-hosted-runners-private-networking-with-azure-virtual-networks-public-beta">Azure private networking for GitHub-hosted runners &#8211; Public Beta</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.blog">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we&#039;re announcing that Private Networking for GitHub-hosted runners with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview">Azure Virtual Networks (VNET)</a> is now in public beta. This feature allows GitHub Enterprise customers using Azure to integrate their GitHub-hosted runners directly into an Azure VNET under their Azure account.</p>
<h4 id="key-benefits" id="key-benefits" >Key Benefits<a href="#key-benefits" class="heading-link pl-2 text-italic text-bold" aria-label="Key Benefits"></a></h4>
<p>What sets this apart is the dual advantage it offers. On one hand, you can continue to enjoy the benefits of GitHub-managed resources. On the other hand, you gain full control over the networking policies applied to those resources. Once your GitHub-hosted runners are connected to your Azure VNET, your Actions workflows can securely access Azure services like Azure Storage and on-premises data sources such as artifactory through existing, pre-configured connections like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways">VPN gateways</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction">ExpressRoutes</a>. </p>
<p>Security is also front and center in this update. Any existing or new networking policies, such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview">Network Security Group (NSG)</a> rules, will automatically apply to GitHub-hosted runners giving platform administrators comprehensive control over network security.</p>
<p>To further simplify the management of Azure private networking settings across different business units, we&#039;re introducing Network Configurations. This feature allows administrators to consolidate various networking settings and assign them to runner groups based on specific operational needs. For example, production-grade runners can be configured with stricter networking policies using a dedicated Azure VNET, as opposed to runners used for testing or staging environments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/30297258/279438904-f5780dbf-1138-4dae-b6a7-62ea733867d9.png?ssl=1" alt="image" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Starting today, Azure Private Networking and Network Configurations are available in public beta for GitHub Enterprise Cloud users. To get started, navigate to the &#039;Hosted Compute Networking&#039; section within your Enterprise settings. For more details, consult our <a href="https://github.co/actions-azure-vnet">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We&#039;re eager to hear your feedback to further improve this feature. Share your thoughts on our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/58739">GitHub Community Discussion</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce the beta release of Copilot in GitHub Support, a faster way to find answers to your GitHub related questions! In August, we launched the Alpha to a limited number of randomly selected GitHub Enterprise Cloud customers. We have made lots of improvements to the experience since and are excited to welcome more customers into the new experience. Copilot in GitHub Support is now trained on the latest <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10">GitHub Enterprise Server documentation</a> in addition to GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation it was previously trained on.</p>
<p>Initially, we&#8217;re offering the Copilot experience to a limited number of randomly selected GitHub Enterprise customers. We hope to continue rolling out the experience to a wider audience over the coming months.</p>
<p>During the beta, GitHub will be reviewing answers provided and collecting feedback from participating customers to improve the accuracy.</p>
<p>Copilot in GitHub Support is part of our ongoing effort to make GitHub the best place for all developers to collaborate, innovate, and ship great software. We believe that Copilot in GitHub Support will enhance your experience and productivity.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you and learning from your feedback.</p>
